# Description

Designed a simple command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the database. 

I am using Python and the sqlite3 library in it. This is fairly basic but covers everything from displaying data to deleting, updating, droping and creating.

rule.txt is where all the commands are explained and defined in a more simplified way.
