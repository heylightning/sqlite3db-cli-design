Here are the list of commands that you can play with:

1. CREATE
2. INSERT
3. SELECT 
4. UPDATE
5. DELETE
6. DROP

*Note: (Syntax Definations are case-sensitive.)

Syntax Definations:

1. CREATE
$>>> CREATE TABLE <table-name>
(
    <column1> <datatype>,
    <column2> <datatype>,
    .
    .
    .
);
(This will help us to create a table inside a database.)

2. INSERT
$>>> INSERT INTO <table-name>
VALUES ("value1", "value2", "value3", ...);
(This will help us to insert values in the table.)

3. SELECT 
$>>> SELECT * FROM <table-name>;
(For now we don't have clause compatibility in SELECT query (only WHERE is compatible.). Probably be available in Version 1.0.1. This will help us to display all the values in the database.)

$>>> SELECT ONE FROM <table-name>;
(This will display the first value in the table.)

$>>> SELECT * FROM <table-name>
WHERE <column1> = <value1>;
(This is how we can integrate where clause compatibility into our system.)

$>>> SELECT ONE FROM <table-name>
WHERE <column1> = <value1>;
(WHERE clause will work with ONE as well.)

4. UPDATE
$>>> UPDATE <table-name>
SET <column1> = <value1>
WHERE <column2> = <value2>;
(This is how we can integrate UPDATE query into our system.)

5. DELETE
$>>> DELETE FROM <table-name>
WHERE <column1> = <value1>;
(This is how we can integrate DELETE query into our system.)

6. DROP
$>>> DROP <table-name>;
(This will drop the table inside the seleted database.)

The main controller cursor will look like this:

heylightning/sqlite3db-cli-design (experiX)
$>>>

Here, (experiX) is representing that it is the primary database that has been selected.

Further updates will be notified as they are made.
